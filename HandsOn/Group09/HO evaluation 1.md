   ### General Analysis
- [x] The resource naming strategy should use different paths for ontology resources and individuals.
- [x] Property URIs should not be related to class URIs. The reason for this is that properties are independent of the class and could be used in other classes.

    ### Ontology
- [x] Some of the properties defined with numbers as ranges are not numbers.
- [x] In OWL, there are object properties (where value of the property is a resource) and datatype properties (where the value of the property is a string literal, usually             typed). 
- [x] Check that all class names start with capital letter.
   ### RDF generated
 - [x] URIs are encoded as strings.
 - [x] It is not clear which resources will be used for linking.
